/*
interrupt service routine

this badass motherfucker is called every time an interrupt occours (if not masked,
of course), and interrupts are already disabled. all it does is to perform a run on
the interrupt service routine pointer array and verify if there is a handler for the
interrupt. if so, it calls it. if not, it clears the mask for that interrupt (which
should be cleared anyway) and then the process iterates. when done, the function
returns and cpu context is restored to the state before the interrupt. an exception
is a timer interrupt, when in this case control is restored by the dispacher, since
the task was preempted and it should really happen that way.
